## Warriors Data Set (2016-2017)

During the first month of the course, you worked with a handful of data sets
from NBA players obtained from the website _Basketball Reference_. Likewise, 
the data sets you worked with were, for the most part, already cleaned. In fact, 
you didn't have to worry about dealing with the raw format and transforming 
some of the variables.

But now we need to talk more about the __Data Preparation__ process, which 
usually involves manipulating characters. For this tutorial we are going to
consider the Roster data of Golden State Warriors (GSW, 2016-2017). The 
original data is in a table that is part of an html document (i.e. a webpage)

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2017.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2017.html)

![GSW Roster](../images/gsw-2017-roster.png)

I'm assuming that you clicked on the link that takes you to the page containing 
the Roster table. I'm also assuming that you are using google Chrome as your 
browser. To see the actual html format of the webpage, go to the menu
bar, select _View_, click on _Developer_, and choose _View Source_.
You should be able to see the content in html syntax of the html document.
Don't worry if you are not familiar with html syntax, it's just another type
of markup syntax like Markdown.

The important thing is the fact that html files are also text files, and they 
are made up of characters. Inspect the contents of the file and find the html table for the Roster data; this table
should start at line 1183.


### Download the html file

The first step consists of downloading a copy of the html file. This can be 
done from R with the function `download.file()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# download html file to your working directory
url <- 'https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2017.html'

download.file(url, destfile = 'gsw-roster-2017.html')
```


### Import an HTML table

There are various ways to read in the content of the `gsw-roster-2017.html`
file in R. Because we are just interested in the part of the file that has to 
do with the Roster table, we can use the function `readHTMLTable()` from the 
package `"XML"`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("XML")
library(XML)
tbl <- readHTMLTable('gsw-roster-2017.html', which = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ''}
tbl <- readHTMLTable('../data/gsw-roster-2017.html', which = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

tbl
```


### Case Folding

Let's begin with some basic manipulations: converting characters to lower or upper case.

```{r}
# player name in lower case
tolower(tbl$Player)
```

```{r}
# player name in upper case
toupper(tbl$Player)
```

-----

## Processing Height

Let's do something more interesting: transforming the _height_ values. Focus on the column `Ht`

```{r}
# height
tbl$Ht
```

Notice that the values of `Ht` are formed by one digit number, a dash, and another number of one or two digits. Note also that all values are of type character. How can we transform this values into a height expressed just in inches, and of data type real? Meet the `substr()` function.


### Function `substr()`

Because in this case the `Ht` values follow a simple positional structure, we can use the function `substr()`. This function takes a character vector, a starting position, and a stopping position. `substr()` produces substrings based on the given positions:

```{r}
# extract feet
feet <- substr(x = tbl$Ht, start = 1, stop = 1)
feet
```

```{r}
# extract inches
inches <- substr(x = tbl$Ht, start = 3, stop = 4)
inches
```

Because both `feet` and `inches` are character vectors, we need to coerce them as numeric. And then we can compute the hieght in inches:

```{r}
feet <- as.numeric(feet)
inches <- as.numeric(inches)
height <- feet * 12 + inches
summary(height)
```

-----

## Processing Birth Date

Now let's look at the column `Birth Date`. To select refer to the name of this column you need to use back ticks:

```{r}
tbl$`Birth Date`
```

### Function `strsplit()`

How do we extract the month? Notice that month is the first word that appears
before the first blank space. But names of months have different lengths, and thus different positions. So we cannot use `substr()`.

The common pattern is the first blank space, and we can use this information to __split__ the strings with the function `strsplit()`:

```{r}
split_date <- strsplit(x = tbl$`Birth Date`, split = " ")
head(split_date)
```

The object `split_date` is a list. Each element is a character vector formed
by the name of the month, the day follwed by a comma, and the year.

To select the months, you would need to iterate through the elements of
`split_date`, and select the first element:

```{r}
# empty vector of length 0
month_names <- c()

# memory inefficient loop
for (elem in 1:5) {
  month_names <- c(month_names, split_date[[elem]][1])
}
month_names
```

The previous code works, but it can be inefficient due to the way we are building `month_names`: at each iteration, we create a new vector `month_names` inside `c()`.

Here's another option to get the names of the months:

```{r}
# empty vector of length 0
month_names <- c()

# memory inefficient loop
for (elem in 1:5) {
  month_names[elem] <- split_date[[elem]][1]
}
month_names
```

The previous code works, but it is also inefficient because `month_names` gets expanded by one element at each iteration.

It would be better to allocate the object with the adequate length from the
beginning:

```{r}
# empty vector with 5 elements
month_names <- rep('', 5)

# memory efficient loop
for (elem in 1:5) {
  month_names[elem] <- split_date[[elem]][1]
}
month_names
```

Now let's run the loop with all the month names:

```{r}
month_names <- rep('', length(split_date))

for (elem in 1:length(split_date)) {
  month_names[elem] <- split_date[[elem]][1]
}
```


### Vectorized loops: `lapply()` and `sapply()`

Alternatively, you can use the `lapply()` and/or `sapply()` functions, which
are vectorized loops. These functions are part of the `apply()` family, which allow you to apply a function to the elements of a given R object.

To use `lapply()` you need to identify what is the function that must be applied. In this example, the function is selecting the first value of each element in `split_date`.

Here's how to use `lapply()`, specifying a nonym function in the `FUN = ` argument:

```{r}
# anonym function within `lapply()`
lmonths <- lapply(split_date, FUN = function(u) u[1])
head(lmonths, n = 5)
```

Notice that `lapply()` returns an R list; this is why it's _lapply_: for "list apply".

A related function is `sapply()` which attempts to return a simplified object when possible. In this 
example the output can be _simplified_ from a list to a vector:

```{r}
# anonym function within `sapply()`
month_names <- sapply(split_date, FUN = function(u) u[1])
month_names
```

How would you extract:

- the day values?
- the year values?


-----

## Processing Experience

You've worked with _Experience_ before in a couple of assignments. 

```{r}
tbl$Exp
```

The variable `Exp` contains numbers and the letter `"R"`. A value of `"R"` indicates that the player is a _Rookie_, which means the player has 0 years of experience in the NBA.

One option to replace `"R"` with zeros is with a logical subsetting operation:

```{r}
experience <- tbl$Exp
experience[tbl$Exp == 'R'] <- 0
experience <- as.numeric(experience)
experience
```

Another option is with the `sub()` function which takes a `pattern`, 
a `replacement` value, and an object `x` on which to perform the substitution:

```{r}
exp_years <- tbl$Exp
exp_years <- sub(pattern = 'R', replacement = 0, exp_years)
exp_years <- as.numeric(exp_years)
```
